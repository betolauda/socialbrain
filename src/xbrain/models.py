    are re-declared so the field shape is wire-identical) AND a vision

    Decorative photos (avatars, reaction memes, abstract backgrounds)
    reach this variant too — they carry `is_decorative=True` and an

    `description_version` is the rubric/version tag the description was

    by a model-level validator below so a hand-constructed variant
    cannot violate the invariant. The vision rubric returns an empty
